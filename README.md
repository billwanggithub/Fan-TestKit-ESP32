# ESP32-S3 PWM + RPM Capture

Firmware for the YD-ESP32-S3-COREBOARD V1.4 (ESP32-S3-WROOM-1, 16 MB flash,
8 MB octal PSRAM). Generates a glitch-free PWM up to 1 MHz and captures
tachometer RPM with a moving-averaged, configurable-timeout pipeline.
Controllable from an Android phone via a Wi-Fi web dashboard (BLE used only
for provisioning) and from a PC host via USB composite (HID + CDC).

The full design is in `C:\Users\billw\.claude\plans\read-the-project-plan-pure-eagle.md`.
The release-hardening checklist is in `docs/release-hardening.md`.

## Status (2026-04-22)

Migrated to **ESP-IDF v6.0** (was v5.5.1). PWM band-cross verified on
scope; Wi-Fi provisioning, HTTP dashboard, WebSocket, USB composite
(HID + CDC), PWM, RPM all working end-to-end on hardware.

Secure Boot V2 + Flash Encryption are **currently disabled** —
they caused a boot loop on first power-on with the untouched eFuse set.
Tracking in [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) Bug 1.

PWM frequency floor is **10 Hz** (was 5 Hz under v5.5.1). v6.0 changed
the MCPWM driver's default group prescaler, raising the LO band
resolution. Details in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) "PWM glitch-free update
mechanism".

## First-time build (Windows 11)

1. **Install the ESP-IDF v6.0 Python venv** (one-off). Open a plain
   `cmd.exe` and run:

   ```bat
   C:\esp\v6.0\esp-idf\install.bat esp32s3
   ```

2. **Activate IDF** in your shell (each new terminal session). Easiest:

   - **Desktop shortcut "ESP-IDF 6.0 PWM Project"** — opens new
     PowerShell with env active and cwd at this project.
   - **`esp6 pwm` PowerShell alias** — activates v6.0 + cd to project
     in the current PowerShell window. Defined in your PowerShell
     profile.

   Manual activation if you prefer:

   - **cmd.exe**: `C:\esp\v6.0\esp-idf\export.bat`
   - **PowerShell**: `C:\esp\v6.0\esp-idf\export.ps1`
   - **Git Bash / MSYS2**: `source /c/esp/v6.0/esp-idf/export.sh`

3. **Build, flash**:

   ```bat
   cd D:\github\ESP32_PWM
   idf.py build
   idf.py -p COM24 flash monitor
   ```

   Target is locked to esp32s3 in `sdkconfig.defaults` so no
   `set-target` needed. First build pulls four managed dependencies
   from the component registry (see `main/idf_component.yml`):
   `espressif/esp_tinyusb`, `espressif/network_provisioning`,
   `espressif/cjson`, plus `espressif/tinyusb` as a transitive dep.
   Replace `COM24` with what Windows Device Manager assigns to the
   CH343P bridge on USB1.

### sdkconfig trap

`idf.py fullclean` wipes `build/` but **keeps `sdkconfig`**. Any change
to `sdkconfig.defaults` for a Kconfig symbol already present in
`sdkconfig` is silently ignored. When modifying partition layout,
Secure Boot, Flash Encryption, or TinyUSB Kconfig run:

```bat
del sdkconfig
idf.py fullclean
idf.py build
```

## Board jumper

The onboard USB2 port routes to either the native USB peripheral (TinyUSB)
or the built-in USB-JTAG. By default the `USB-JTAG` 0 ohm jumper is bridged.
For the HID + CDC composite device to enumerate on the PC, move the bridge
to **USB-OTG**. Logs still appear on UART0 via USB1 regardless.

## Pin map

| GPIO | Role                                    |
|------|-----------------------------------------|
| 4    | PWM output                              |
| 5    | PWM change-trigger (pulse on each set)  |
| 6    | RPM capture input                       |
| 19   | USB D-  (reserved by board)             |
| 20   | USB D+  (reserved by board)             |
| 48   | Onboard WS2812 RGB status LED           |

All configurable under `idf.py menuconfig` -> *ESP32 PWM App*.

## Interacting with the device

- **UART console** (USB1, CH343P): commands `pwm <freq> <duty>`,
  `rpm_params <pole> <mavg>`, `rpm_timeout <us>`, `status`, `help`.
  Baud rate is 115200.
- **BLE provisioning** (NimBLE): on first boot the device advertises as
  `ESP32-PWM`, PoP = `abcd1234`. Use the Espressif **ESP BLE
  Provisioning** app (Android / iOS) to enter Wi-Fi credentials.
  Credentials persist in NVS; subsequent boots skip provisioning and
  reconnect automatically.
- **Web dashboard** (Wi-Fi): once provisioned and online, browse to
  `http://<device-ip>/`. PWM freq/duty Apply, RPM params, live status
  (20 Hz WebSocket push), OTA upload form all work.
- **USB HID/CDC** (USB2, native USB with jumper on **USB-OTG**): the
  board enumerates as `USB Composite Device` → `HID-compliant
  vendor-defined device` + `USB 序列裝置 (COMx)`. HID report IDs and
  CDC SLIP frame ops are defined in
  `components/usb_composite/include/usb_protocol.h`.
