# Fan-TestKit (ESP32-S3 PWM + RPM Capture)

Firmware for the YD-ESP32-S3-COREBOARD V1.4 (ESP32-S3-WROOM-1, 16 MB flash,
8 MB octal PSRAM). Generates a glitch-free PWM up to 1 MHz, captures
tachometer RPM with a moving-averaged, configurable-timeout pipeline,
and drives a bench DC PSU (Riden RD60xx, XY-SK120, or WZ5005 — runtime
selectable). Controllable from an Android phone via a Wi-Fi web
dashboard (SoftAP captive portal for first-time setup) and from a PC
host via USB composite (HID + CDC).

The full design is in `C:\Users\billw\.claude\plans\read-the-project-plan-pure-eagle.md`.
The release-hardening checklist is in `docs/release-hardening.md`.

## Status (2026-04-26)

NVS-persisted runtime tunables landed: RPM pole/mavg/timeout, PWM
freq, and dashboard slider step sizes (duty/freq) all survive
reboot via explicit Save commands reachable from all four
transports (WS / HID / CDC / CLI). PWM duty deliberately resets to
0 on boot regardless of saved state — safety invariant for
unsupervised restart. New `components/ui_settings/` component owns
step sizes; dashboard now reads them from the WS status frame so
all browser clients stay in sync. Full design + per-task wiring in
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-26-nvs-persisted-settings.md`; NVS
contract summary in `CLAUDE.md`.

Earlier (2026-04-26): multi-family PSU support landed. `psu_driver/`
dispatches to one of three backends (`riden` / `xy_sk120` /
`wz5005`) at boot, picked from NVS via the dashboard PSU panel's
Family dropdown or the CLI `psu_family <name>`. Hardware
verification still pending — see `HANDOFF.md` for the open D-series
tasks.

Earlier (2026-04-22): migrated to **ESP-IDF v6.0** (was v5.5.1). PWM
band-cross verified on scope; Wi-Fi provisioning, HTTP dashboard,
WebSocket, USB composite (HID + CDC), PWM, RPM all working end-to-end
on hardware.

Secure Boot V2 + Flash Encryption are **currently disabled** —
they caused a boot loop on first power-on with the untouched eFuse set.
Tracking in [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) Bug 1.

PWM frequency floor is **10 Hz** (was 5 Hz under v5.5.1). v6.0 changed
the MCPWM driver's default group prescaler, raising the LO band
resolution. Details in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) "PWM glitch-free update
mechanism".

## First-time build (Windows 11)

1. **Install the ESP-IDF v6.0 Python venv** (one-off). Open a plain
   `cmd.exe` and run:

   ```bat
   C:\esp\v6.0\esp-idf\install.bat esp32s3
   ```

2. **Activate IDF** in your shell (each new terminal session). Easiest:

   - **Desktop shortcut "ESP-IDF 6.0 PWM Project"** — opens new
     PowerShell with env active and cwd at this project.
   - **`esp6 pwm` PowerShell alias** — activates v6.0 + cd to project
     in the current PowerShell window. Defined in your PowerShell
     profile.

   Manual activation if you prefer:

   - **cmd.exe**: `C:\esp\v6.0\esp-idf\export.bat`
   - **PowerShell**: `C:\esp\v6.0\esp-idf\export.ps1`
   - **Git Bash / MSYS2**: `source /c/esp/v6.0/esp-idf/export.sh`

3. **Build, flash**:

   ```bat
   cd D:\github\Fan-TestKit-ESP32
   idf.py build
   idf.py -p COM24 flash monitor
   ```

   Target is locked to esp32s3 in `sdkconfig.defaults` so no
   `set-target` needed. First build pulls managed dependencies
   from the component registry (see `main/idf_component.yml`):
   `espressif/esp_tinyusb`, `espressif/cjson`, `espressif/mdns`,
   plus `espressif/tinyusb` as a transitive dep. Replace `COM24`
   with what Windows Device Manager assigns to the CH343P bridge
   on USB1.

### sdkconfig trap

`idf.py fullclean` wipes `build/` but **keeps `sdkconfig`**. Any change
to `sdkconfig.defaults` for a Kconfig symbol already present in
`sdkconfig` is silently ignored. When modifying partition layout,
Secure Boot, Flash Encryption, or TinyUSB Kconfig run:

```bat
del sdkconfig
idf.py fullclean
idf.py build
```

## Board jumper

The onboard USB2 port routes to either the native USB peripheral (TinyUSB)
or the built-in USB-JTAG. By default the `USB-JTAG` 0 ohm jumper is bridged.
For the HID + CDC composite device to enumerate on the PC, move the bridge
to **USB-OTG**. Logs still appear on UART0 via USB1 regardless.

## Pin map

| GPIO | Role                                    |
|------|-----------------------------------------|
| 4    | PWM output                              |
| 5    | PWM change-trigger (pulse on each set)  |
| 6    | RPM capture input                       |
| 19   | USB D-  (reserved by board)             |
| 20   | USB D+  (reserved by board)             |
| 38   | UART1 TX → PSU RX                       |
| 39   | UART1 RX ← PSU TX                       |
| 48   | Onboard WS2812 RGB status LED           |

PWM/RPM/LED pins configurable under `idf.py menuconfig` →
*Fan-TestKit App*. PSU pins + baud + slave default + family choice
under *PSU driver* (separate menu).

## Interacting with the device

- **UART console** (USB1, CH343P): commands `pwm <freq> <duty>`,
  `rpm_params <pole> <mavg>`, `rpm_timeout <us>`, `psu_v <volts>`,
  `psu_i <amps>`, `psu_out <0|1>`, `psu_slave <addr>`,
  `psu_family <name>`, `psu_status`, `status`, `help`. Baud is 115200.
  Save-to-NVS commands: `save_rpm_params`, `save_rpm_timeout`,
  `save_pwm_freq`, `save_ui_steps <duty> <freq>` — each persists the
  current live value(s) so they survive reboot. Saved PWM freq is
  reapplied at boot; saved duty is **not** a concept (boot duty is
  always 0).
- **SoftAP captive portal** (first-time setup): on a board without
  stored Wi-Fi credentials, the device brings up an open AP named
  `Fan-TestKit-setup`. Join it from your phone and open **any** URL in
  the browser — a DNS hijack redirects everything to the setup page.
  On some Android phones the captive-portal "Sign in to Wi-Fi network"
  notification fires automatically (stock Android 11+ works best);
  Samsung One UI often doesn't fire it and needs a manual browser tap.
  Enter your home SSID + password; on success the page shows both
  `http://fan-testkit.local/` and the assigned raw IP. Credentials
  persist in NVS so subsequent boots skip the AP and go straight to
  STA.
- **Web dashboard** (Wi-Fi, after provisioning): browse to the raw IP
  shown on the success page (e.g. `http://192.168.1.47/`). The mDNS
  name `http://fan-testkit.local/` works in desktop browsers (Windows
  with Bonjour, macOS, Linux with Avahi) but Chrome and most Android
  browsers don't resolve `.local` names — use the raw IP there. PWM
  freq/duty Apply, RPM params, live status (20 Hz WebSocket push),
  OTA upload form all work.
- **USB HID/CDC** (USB2, native USB with jumper on **USB-OTG**): the
  board enumerates as `USB Composite Device` → `HID-compliant
  vendor-defined device` + `USB 序列裝置 (COMx)`. HID report IDs and
  CDC SLIP frame ops are defined in
  `components/usb_composite/include/usb_protocol.h`.
- **IP Announcer (ntfy.sh push)** — opt-in feature that pushes the
  device's IP to your phone via ntfy.sh after every Wi-Fi connection.
  Solves the "Android Chrome can't resolve `fan-testkit.local` on a
  phone hotspot with randomised subnet" problem. Install the ntfy
  Android / iOS app, subscribe to your auto-generated topic (shown on
  the captive-portal success page), enable from Settings → IP
  Announcer in the dashboard. Topic resolution: NVS → Kconfig
  `APP_IP_ANNOUNCER_TOPIC_DEFAULT` (set in `sdkconfig.defaults.local`
  for personal multi-board builds) → random `fan-testkit-<32 chars>`
  fallback. Topics matching `CHANGE-ME-*` or shorter than 16 chars
  are refused at runtime to prevent placeholder leaks.

## Bench DC PSU (UART1)

The firmware drives a serial-controlled bench PSU on UART1 (GPIO 38
TX, GPIO 39 RX, common GND). Three families are supported and
selectable at runtime — same wiring for all of them, only the
protocol changes:

| Family | Protocol | Factory baud | Slave default |
|--------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| `riden` | Modbus-RTU (RD6006/RD6012/RD6018/RD6024) | 115200 | 1 |
| `xy_sk120` | Modbus-RTU (XY-SK120) | 115200 | 1 |
| `wz5005` | Custom 20-byte sum-checksum | 19200 | 1 |

Workflow:

1. Dashboard PSU panel → **Family** dropdown → pick family → **Save**
   → **Reboot**. (Or CLI: `psu_family wz5005`, then power-cycle / reset.)
2. Wire the PSU: ESP **GPIO 38** (TX) → PSU **RX**; ESP **GPIO 39**
   (RX) ← PSU **TX**; **GND ↔ GND**. Don't connect VCC.
3. Set the PSU's panel baud + slave to match firmware (or override the
   firmware via `idf.py menuconfig` → *PSU driver*).
4. WZ5005 only: panel must be in **COM** mode (not WIFI) — see manual
   section 1.4.2.5 item 3.

Boot log on success: `psu_driver: UART1 ready: family=X ... baud=Y
slave=N` followed by `psu_<family>: detected ...`. Dashboard PSU panel
shows green `link=up` within ~1 s.

Family + slave are NVS-persisted (namespace `psu_driver`). Family change
is **boot-effective** — the dashboard's Reboot button completes the
swap. Hot-swap is intentionally not supported (different baud + framing
per family makes mid-flight swaps risky).

Full wiring guide + failure modes: [docs/Power_Supply_Module.md](docs/Power_Supply_Module.md).

## Factory reset (re-provisioning Wi-Fi)

To forget the currently-stored Wi-Fi credentials and drop the device
back into SoftAP setup mode on next boot, trigger one of these (they
all land on the same core handler, call `esp_wifi_restore()`, then
reboot):

1. **Web dashboard** — on `http://<device-ip>/`, scroll to the
   "Factory reset" panel and click the red button. A `confirm()`
   dialog asks before sending.
2. **BOOT button** — hold the on-board BOOT button for **≥3 seconds**.
   Short presses are ignored so a casual touch during dev work won't
   wipe credentials.
3. **USB HID** — send report id `0x03` with a 1-byte payload `0xA5`
   (magic byte guard).
4. **USB CDC** — send SLIP-framed op `0x20` with a 1-byte payload
   `0xA5`. The device replies with op `0x21` (ack) before restarting.

After restart the device brings up the `Fan-TestKit-setup` open AP; join
it from your phone and the captive portal will pop up automatically.

Manual fallback if the firmware is unreachable (wedged, bricked): on
the desktop ESP-IDF shell, `idf.py -p COMn erase-flash` followed by
a re-flash clears all NVS.
