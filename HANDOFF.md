# Hand-off — Fan-TestKit firmware (ESP32-S3 PWM + RPM)

Date: 2026-04-29 (cold-boot ntfy push silently dropped — fixed)
Branch: `main`
Working dir: `D:\github\Fan-TestKit-ESP32`
IDF: `C:\esp\v6.0\esp-idf`

## 2026-04-29 — Cold-boot IP announcer push never fired (event-loop ordering)

Symptom: every cold boot, `prov: got ip: ...` printed in the monitor but
no ntfy push went out. `ip_announcer_push: ...` log lines that should
follow were absent. Hot-boot (factory reset → reprovision in same power
cycle) actually pushed correctly, which masked the bug for a while.

Root cause (in `components/ip_announcer/ip_announcer.c`): the IP_EVENT
handler was never actually registered. `app_main` correctly called
`ip_announcer_init()` *before* `net_dashboard_start()` so the handler
would exist before provisioning fired the first IP_EVENT_STA_GOT_IP.
But `esp_event_loop_create_default()` was buried inside
`provisioning_run_and_connect()` (`components/net_dashboard/provisioning.c`),
which ran *after* `ip_announcer_init()`. IDF v6.0
`esp_event_handler_register` returns `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` when the
default loop hasn't been created yet (see
`components/esp_event/default_event_loop.c:20`). The old ip_announcer
code interpreted that error as "loop already exists, harmless" and
swallowed it via `ESP_LOGD` — which doesn't print at the default log
level. Net result: register call returned without registering, no log,
no push.

`prov: got ip` still printed because `provisioning.c` registered its
*own* IP_EVENT handler **after** creating the default loop, so prov
saw the event. Only ip_announcer was blind.

Fix (4 files):

- `main/app_main.c`: hoist `esp_netif_init()` + `esp_event_loop_create_default()`
  to run *before* `ip_announcer_init()`. Also added `esp_event.h` /
  `esp_netif.h` includes.
- `main/CMakeLists.txt`: add `esp_netif` to REQUIRES.
- `components/net_dashboard/provisioning.c`: remove the duplicate
  `esp_netif_init` / `esp_event_loop_create_default` calls (now in app_main).
- `components/ip_announcer/ip_announcer.c`: remove the bogus
  "INVALID_STATE means already-exists" branch — INVALID_STATE here is
  fatal (loop missing), so a future re-misordering will abort at
  `ESP_ERROR_CHECK` instead of silently dropping the push.

Verified on hardware: cold boot now logs
`ip_announcer: IP <addr> — enqueueing push` immediately after
`prov: got ip:`, ntfy notification arrives.

Lesson: never `LOGD` an error you didn't actually understand. If a
return value's semantics are unclear, look up the IDF source before
assuming it's benign.

## 2026-04-26 — NVS-persisted runtime settings

End-to-end plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-26-nvs-persisted-settings.md`.

What's new:

- Three NVS namespaces + new `components/ui_settings/` component
  (see CLAUDE.md "NVS-persisted runtime tunables" section).
- HID descriptor grew 83 → 93 bytes for new report id `0x06`.
- CDC ops `0x50..0x53` for the four save commands.
- WS status frame now includes `"ui":{"duty_step":..,"freq_step":..}`
  at 20 Hz; dashboard's localStorage step persistence is gone.
- PWM freq survives reboot; duty always boots to 0.

What was deliberately not done:

- `psu_driver` not migrated to the new NVS error-propagation policy.
- HID save reports do NOT round-trip an "ok" status (fire-and-forget;
  consistent with existing usb_protocol contract).
- Manual reflash + browser test required for end-to-end Phase 3
  acceptance — software-only verification was build-clean only.

## 2026-04-26 — Dashboard RPM chart auto-scales both ways

The RPM live chart (`components/net_dashboard/web/app.js`) used to ratchet
its Y-axis up only — once the trace had visited e.g. 8000 RPM, the axis
stayed at 8000 forever and subsequent low-RPM traces hugged the bottom of
the chart unreadably. Initial axis was 2000, step 500.

New behaviour: every `drawChart` call recomputes `yAxisMax` from the
visible window's max RPM (`rpmHistory` is already pruned to the rolling
15 s window):

```text
target = max(MIN_AXIS, ceil(visibleMax × 1.1 / STEP) × STEP)
```

with `Y_AXIS_MIN = 500`, `Y_AXIS_STEP = 500`, `Y_AXIS_HEADROOM = 1.1`.
Axis grows AND shrinks as old high samples scroll off the right edge.
500-RPM floor prevents the axis collapsing to a 1-RPM noise band when
the fan is stopped; 10 % headroom keeps brief overshoots from clipping.

The grow-only `bumpYAxisIfNeeded(rpm)` function is gone — its job is now
a special case of the new `autoScaleYAxis()`, called from inside
`drawChart` rather than from `setRpmFromDevice`. Tick-label DOM update
(`#y-ticks` 5 spans: max / 75% / 50% / 25% / 0) extracted into
`updateYTicks()` and only fires when `yAxisMax` actually changes — no
DOM thrash at the 20 Hz telemetry rate.

Verified manually in browser: drove fan up to ~6000 RPM (axis grew to
7000), dropped to ~1000 RPM and waited 15 s (axis shrank to 1500), fan
stopped (axis settled at the 500 floor).

## 2026-04-26 — PWM band-cross bug root-caused, real fix landed

The "v6.0 MCPWM band-cross workaround" tracked in the **OPEN ISSUE**
section below is now resolved. Symptom recap: after a HI→LO or LO→HI
band cross in `pwm_gen.c`, the output frequency was sometimes wrong by
exactly 16× (e.g. 1 kHz request outputs 62.5 Hz, or 100 Hz outputs
1.6 kHz). The previous "workaround" (forcing `LOG_MAXIMUM_LEVEL_DEBUG`
plus a runtime `esp_log_level_set("mcpwm", ESP_LOG_DEBUG)`) narrowed
the race but never closed it; the bug intermittently fired under
Wi-Fi RX or telemetry load.

**Root cause** (confirmed via `timer_status` register diagnostic):
ESP32-S3 MCPWM `timer_period` and `timer_prescale` live in shadow
registers. Even with `timer_period_upmethod=0` ("immediate") set by
the driver, the active-register flush is not actually atomic with the
shadow write — observed directly by reading `timer_status.timer_value`
right after `mcpwm_new_timer` returns and seeing the counter still at
the OLD peak (e.g. ~25000) while the shadow had the NEW peak (e.g.
2000). Counter increment rate measured at 100 µs intervals confirmed
the active prescale was also stale (650 kHz vs configured 10 MHz).

**Fix** (in `reconfigure_for_band`, `components/pwm_gen/pwm_gen.c`):
right after `mcpwm_new_timer` returns, software-sync the timer to
phase=0. The reload-to-zero is itself a TEZ event, which forces a
shadow→active flush for both prescale and period atomically. Sync
input is briefly enabled, fired via the auto-clear `timer_sync_sw`
toggle, then disabled again. Uses private `MCPWM0` register access
(`hal/mcpwm_ll.h` + `soc/mcpwm_struct.h` added to component
`PRIV_REQUIRES`). Verified on scope across hundreds of LO↔HI crosses
under Wi-Fi load — no 62.5 Hz outliers.

**Removed (no longer needed)**:

- `CONFIG_LOG_MAXIMUM_LEVEL_DEBUG=y` and the choice-group siblings in
  `sdkconfig.defaults` (the LOGD-induced delay was a guess, not the
  fix).
- `esp_log_level_set("mcpwm", ESP_LOG_DEBUG)` in `pwm_gen_init`.
- The `STOP_EMPTY → START_NO_STOP` "double-tap" in
  `reconfigure_for_band` — once the soft-sync flushes shadow→active,
  the prescale-latch concern that motivated it is also resolved.

The 🟡 OPEN ISSUE section further down (header level "v6.0 MCPWM
band-cross workaround not understood") describes the workaround era;
keep it for archaeology but the bug is closed.

## 2026-04-26 — PSU multi-family driver (riden / xy_sk120 / wz5005)

Renamed `components/psu_modbus/` → `components/psu_driver/` and split
into a vtable dispatcher + 3 backends behind a runtime-selectable
`psu_family` NVS key. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-26-psu-multi-driver-design.md`.
Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-26-psu-multi-driver.md`.

Layout after the work:

```text
components/psu_driver/
  psu_driver.c          dispatcher + atomic state + NVS + UART setup
  psu_modbus_rtu.{c,h}  shared CRC-16 + FC 0x03/0x06 helpers
  psu_riden.c           Riden RD60xx register map + RD_MODELS table
  psu_xy_sk120.c        XY-SK120 register map (model id 22873)
  psu_wz5005.c          WZ5005 custom 20-byte sum-mod-256 framing
  include/psu_driver.h         public API
  include/psu_backend.h        internal vtable + publish helpers
  include/psu_modbus_rtu.h     shared Modbus helper API
  Kconfig.projbuild     family choice + per-family factory baud defaults
```

Family selection surface:

- **Dashboard PSU panel**: Family `<select>` + Save + Reboot (the
  family/slave/Reboot row stays clickable even when `link=down`,
  which is the escape hatch when the wrong family is selected — see
  `a358aa3` for the CSS-scope fix).
- **CLI**: `psu_family <name>` (`riden|xy_sk120|wz5005`). No-arg
  prints current.
- **WS op**: `{type:"set_psu_family", family:"..."}` and `{type:"reboot"}`.
- **NVS**: namespace `psu_driver`, key `family` (alongside existing
  `slave_addr`). Boot-effective — change requires reboot.

Per-family factory baud defaults (Kconfig):

- `riden` 115200, `xy_sk120` 115200, `wz5005` 19200. If a bench unit
  is panel-keyed differently, override `APP_PSU_UART_BAUD` via
  menuconfig (after `del sdkconfig`).

### Open hardware verification (D-series tasks)

Software verified by build (`fan_testkit.bin` ~0x10c640 bytes, 48%
free in 2 MB partition). On-hardware verification per the plan's
Phase D **not yet done** by user — needs:

- **D1 Riden regression**: with bench RD6006 panel-keyed to 19200,
  override `APP_PSU_UART_BAUD=19200`, reflash, confirm
  `family=riden` log + dashboard `link=up` + V/I sliders work.
- **D2 XY-SK120 acceptance**: switch family via dashboard, set baud
  to 115200, wire SK120, verify model id 22873 detected.
- **D3 WZ5005 acceptance**: critical — confirm V_SET 5.00 → terminals
  read 5.00 V. The 0x2B/0x2C byte-layout in `psu_wz5005.c:wz_read_vi_block`
  is **best-guess** (V_SET 0..1, I_SET 2..3, V_OUT 8..9, I_OUT 10..11);
  if values come back wrong, capture a scope trace and adjust the
  offsets in that one function. Spec design doc lists this as a known
  unknown.
- **D4 Wrong-family graceful failure**: with WZ5005 wired, set
  family=riden via dashboard → reboot → confirm `link=down` within
  ~1 s + UI shows offline + no crash. Then back to `family=wz5005`
  → reboot → recovers.

### Notable decisions

- **Family choice is boot-effective, not hot-swappable.** Different
  baud rates per family + different framers + cached state (especially
  WZ5005's `s_last_vi[16]` for read-modify-write) make mid-flight
  swaps risky. Reboot path is ~2 s and the dashboard has a Reboot
  button next to the family Save, so UX cost is small.
- **WZ5005 layout is best-guess.** The kordian-kowalski reference and
  the manufacturer manual both leave the 0x2B/0x2C byte offsets
  un-documented. We picked the most plausible layout (V_SET hi/lo
  at bytes 0..1, etc.) per spec analysis. Wrong layout would surface
  as visible drift between dashboard and front panel — `link_ok`
  stays true (structural validity OK) but values are wrong.
- **No boot-time CRC self-check** (matches existing Riden posture);
  WZ5005's sum-mod-256 ditto. Constructors run before `ESP_LOG` is
  up — silent traps are debug-hostile. End-to-end via `link_ok`
  is the real test.
- **NVS namespace migration**: old `psu_modbus` → new `psu_driver`.
  Existing devices' slave_addr in the old namespace is ignored on
  first boot of the new firmware; falls back to
  `CONFIG_APP_PSU_SLAVE_DEFAULT` (1). Operator with a non-default
  slave runs `psu_slave N` once after upgrade. Documented in commit
  `37ec4e8` body.

## 2026-04-22 — provisioning migration: BLE → SoftAP captive portal

Dropped `espressif/network_provisioning` + BLE (NimBLE) + PoP-based
protocomm SECURITY_1. Replaced with in-project SoftAP + captive portal
flow (components/net_dashboard/captive_portal.c, dns_hijack.c,
mdns_svc.c). Saves ~60 KB flash, removes the Espressif BLE Provisioning
Android app requirement.

User flow: on boot no creds → AP `Fan-TestKit-setup` + DNS hijack (every
query → 192.168.4.1) + catch-all HTTP 200 with meta-refresh + RFC 8908
`Link: rel="captive-portal"` header. After submit + STA connect, success
page shows `fan-testkit.local` and raw DHCP IP. AP torn down ~25 s later.
Factory reset path (`prov_clear_credentials` → `esp_wifi_restore`)
unchanged for callers.

Hardware validation on 2026-04-22 (Samsung phone, One UI):

- PC (Windows with Bonjour): `http://fan-testkit.local/` resolves, dashboard
  loads.
- Samsung phone, STA side: raw-IP link works; `.local` mDNS does NOT
  resolve (Chrome on Android doesn't do mDNS — long-standing Chromium
  limitation). The success page intentionally shows the raw IP for
  exactly this fallback.
- Samsung phone, captive-portal auto-popup: **does not fire on this
  phone**. Tried 302, 200 + HTML body, RFC 8908 Link header, POST/HEAD
  catch-all, and a port-443 accept+close helper — none made Samsung
  raise the "Sign in to Wi-Fi network" UI. The phone issues exactly
  one malformed HTTP probe (~15 s after DHCP) and gives up silently.
  Suspected cause: Samsung OneUI / carrier policy disables HTTP probe
  fallback and uses HTTPS-only detection.
- Samsung phone, manual flow: works **only when user types the raw IP
  `http://192.168.4.1/`**. Typing a domain name (`http://example.com`,
  `http://google.com`, etc.) fails — Chrome / Samsung Internet now
  default to HTTPS-First and silently upgrade `http://` to `https://`;
  our captive portal doesn't listen on 443, so the TLS handshake fails
  and the browser shows "This site can't be reached" with no fallback
  to HTTP 80. IP literals (`192.168.4.1`) are exempt from HTTPS-First
  since Chrome knows IPs can't have valid certs, so that path stays
  reliable. DNS hijack itself is fine — confirmed 2026-04-23 by logging
  every query in `dns_hijack.c`; phone issues the `example.com` query,
  we answer `192.168.4.1`, phone then tries TLS to `:443` and gives up.
  The first 2026-04-22 validation note that said "browser, navigate to
  anything" was only accurate against the Chrome version installed
  then; current Chrome / One UI Internet breaks it.

Open items:

- iOS not validated. Protocol identical, and iOS captive-portal detection
  is historically more reliable than Android's; likely works out of the
  box, but confirm before shipping to iOS users.
- STA failure doesn't fall back to AP at runtime — user must factory-reset
  to re-enter setup. Acceptable per spec (Q4 in brainstorming).
- Auto-popup on Samsung is **not fixable in firmware**. If we want a
  guaranteed auto-open experience, the options are: (a) ship a
  companion Android app that uses `NsdManager` to find the device after
  provisioning, or (b) print a QR code on the device label that points
  to the setup URL so the user scans instead of relying on captive
  detection. Both are out of scope for this branch.

## 2026-04-22 晚 — factory reset / re-provisioning 四路打通 (commit `7ef24d6`)

之前沒有 runtime 路徑可以清 Wi-Fi credentials，要重新 provision 一定得
`idf.py erase-flash`。現在四種 transport 都能觸發，共用
`net_dashboard_factory_reset()` 當單一 entry point:

1. **Web UI** — dashboard 新增紅色 "Factory reset" 按鈕 + JS `confirm()`
   dialog；WS 送 `{type:"factory_reset"}`，收到 ack 後 device 自己 reboot。
2. **USB HID** — report id `0x03`，1 byte payload，magic `0xA5`。HID
   descriptor 從 53 → 63 bytes，`_Static_assert` 守著。
3. **USB CDC** — SLIP op `0x20` (H→D) + `0x21` (D→H ack)，同樣 magic
   `0xA5` guard。
4. **BOOT 按鈕 (GPIO0)** — 長按 ≥3 秒觸發，50 ms poll cadence。GPIO0 是
   strapping pin 但 runtime 可以當一般 input 用。

核心實作在 `components/net_dashboard/net_dashboard.c` 的
`net_dashboard_factory_reset()` + `factory_reset_task` (200 ms delay 讓
ack frame flush)；wipe 用 `network_prov_mgr_reset_wifi_provisioning()`；
低階 wipe function 叫 `prov_clear_credentials()` 擺在 `prov_internal.h`
(component-private)，public API 才是 `net_dashboard_factory_reset()`。

CLAUDE.md 有完整 section ("Factory reset / reprovision")。README 有
user-facing 使用說明。

Cross-component coupling: `usb_composite` REQUIRES `net_dashboard`
(就像之前已經 REQUIRES `ota_core` 一樣)；`net_dashboard` REQUIRES
`esp_driver_gpio` 做 BOOT button watcher。

## ESP-IDF v6.0 migration — done & verified

Migrated whole project up from v5.5.1 to v6.0. Hardware verification
passed on real board: PWM band cross OK at multiple freqs (10/100/1000/
1000000 Hz), boot log clean, Wi-Fi reconnect from NVS, USB composite
enumerated, BLE provisioning still works.

### Source / config changes applied

- `main/idf_component.yml` — IDF constraint `>=5.5.0` → `>=6.0.0`. Added
  `espressif/network_provisioning ^1.2.0` (replaces removed built-in
  `wifi_provisioning`). cJSON pulled in transitively as
  `espressif/cjson` (was IDF built-in `json`).
- `components/net_dashboard/CMakeLists.txt` — REQUIRES `wifi_provisioning`
  → `espressif__network_provisioning`; `json` → `espressif__cjson`.
- `components/net_dashboard/provisioning.c` — header `wifi_provisioning/*`
  → `network_provisioning/*`; symbol prefix `wifi_prov_*` →
  `network_prov_*`; event ID `WIFI_PROV_CRED_SUCCESS/FAIL` →
  `NETWORK_PROV_WIFI_CRED_SUCCESS/FAIL` (note `WIFI_` infix because the
  new component supports both Wi-Fi and Thread); `WIFI_PROV_END` →
  `NETWORK_PROV_END` (no infix — generic event).
- `components/usb_composite/CMakeLists.txt` — added `esp_ringbuf` to
  REQUIRES; `freertos/ringbuf.h` no longer comes via the freertos
  umbrella in v6.0.
- `components/rpm_cap/rpm_cap.c` — removed `.flags.pull_up` from
  `mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t` (field deleted in v6.0); replaced
  with explicit `gpio_set_pull_mode()` call before
  `mcpwm_new_capture_channel()`.
- `components/pwm_gen/pwm_gen.c` — LO band `resolution_hz` 320 kHz →
  625 kHz, `freq_min` 5 → 10. v6.0 changed
  `MCPWM_GROUP_CLOCK_DEFAULT_PRESCALE` from 2 to 1 (group clock 80 MHz
  → 160 MHz), so the v5.5 LO band no longer fits in the auto-resolver's
  range without forcing a `group prescale conflict`. Floor moves up
  from 5 Hz to 10 Hz; spec impact accepted. CLAUDE.md "PWM glitch-free
  update mechanism" section has the full math.
- `main/CMakeLists.txt` — added `esp_driver_uart` to REQUIRES; v6.0
  split the monolithic `driver` component into per-peripheral pieces
  and `driver/uart.h` no longer comes via the umbrella.
- `sdkconfig.defaults` —
  - `CONFIG_NETWORK_PROV_NETWORK_TYPE_WIFI=y` (unmask Wi-Fi event IDs in
    network_provisioning)
  - `CONFIG_ESP_PROTOCOMM_SUPPORT_SECURITY_VERSION_1=y` (v6.0 changed
    protocomm default away from sec1; we keep PoP-based BLE
    provisioning so we need the enum re-exposed)
  - `CONFIG_LOG_MAXIMUM_LEVEL_DEBUG=y` + sibling `=n` setters (workaround
    for v6.0 MCPWM band-cross bug — see Open issues below)
- Comment in `usb_composite.c` about esp_tinyusb 1.7.x's HID
  limitation still holds; descriptor logic unchanged.

### Tooling

- ESP-IDF v6.0 installed to `C:\esp\v6.0\esp-idf` via
  `install.ps1 esp32s3`. Old v5.5.1 still present at
  `C:\Espressif\frameworks\esp-idf-v5.5.1` for fallback (don't activate
  both at once — Python venv collision).
- Desktop shortcut **"ESP-IDF 6.0 PWM Project"** opens new PowerShell
  with v6.0 env active, cwd at `D:\github\Fan-TestKit-ESP32`. Created via
  WScript.Shell COM in user `Desktop`.
- PowerShell profile alias `esp6` (and `esp6 pwm`) added to
  `D:\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`.

## 🟡 OPEN ISSUE — v6.0 MCPWM band-cross workaround not understood

### Symptom

After v6.0 migration, the first HI band → LO band cross outputs the PWM
at 16× the requested frequency (period correct, prescale not actually
latched). E.g. `pwm 100 50` → scope shows 1.6 kHz instead of 100 Hz.
Driver's `mcpwm_set_prescale` returns OK; computed values are correct
on paper (`group_prescale=1, timer_prescale=256, resolution=625kHz,
period=6250`).

Same bug pattern as the v5.5 STOP→START latch issue we already fixed in
`reconfigure_for_band()` lines 219-235, but our existing fix is no
longer sufficient under v6.0.

### Workaround (currently applied)

Two pieces, both required:

1. `sdkconfig.defaults`: `CONFIG_LOG_MAXIMUM_LEVEL_DEBUG=y` so the
   driver's `LOGD` calls compile in.
2. `pwm_gen_init()` calls `esp_log_level_set("mcpwm", ESP_LOG_DEBUG)`
   so those compiled-in calls actually fire.

Bisected: removing **either** piece reproduces the bug. Both must be
present.

### Suspected (not confirmed) cause

The microseconds spent in driver `LOGD` argument formatting introduce
enough delay between MCPWM register writes for some shadow/latch
register to settle. Without the delay, the next register access reads
stale state. We did NOT confirm this with logic-analyser on the MCPWM
register bus.

### Why we shipped without root cause

Migration was already at the end of a long session; further bisect
would need a minimal repro project (no Wi-Fi/USB) and probably hardware
register tracing. The workaround is non-invasive (cost ~few KB of LOGD
format strings) and explicit at both the source-code site
(`pwm_gen.c:165`) and the Kconfig (`sdkconfig.defaults` LOG_MAXIMUM
section).

### Investigation hooks for next session

- Reproduce on minimal project: just `pwm_gen` + REPL, strip Wi-Fi/USB.
  Confirms it's not interaction with another subsystem.
- If it reproduces, read `/c/esp/v6.0/esp-idf/components/esp_driver_mcpwm/src/`
  changelog vs v5.5.1. Look for the `mcpwm_hal_timer_reset` addition
  (line 105 of `mcpwm_timer.c`) — that's a v6.0-only call that wasn't in
  v5.5; might be the root cause.
- Try replacing the LOGD-trick workaround with explicit
  `esp_rom_delay_us(N)` between specific register writes inside
  `reconfigure_for_band`. Minimum N that fixes it tells you the latch
  window.
- File against ESP-IDF GitHub if root cause is confirmed driver bug.

### Verification recipe

After any pwm_gen.c change, verify on scope:

```text
pwm 100 50    # scope GPIO4 → must read 100 Hz, not 1.6 kHz
pwm 1000 50   # scope GPIO4 → must read 1000 Hz
pwm 100 50    # scope GPIO4 → must read 100 Hz again
```

Each `pwm` REPL command should also print
`D (...) mcpwm: ... module calc prescale:N` line in monitor — if those
lines are missing, the workaround is broken.

## Bring-up status — ✅ 軟體端全部驗證，Secure Boot 待重開 (v5.5.1 era)

Chip: ESP32-S3 (QFN56 rev v0.2), 16 MB flash, 8 MB octal PSRAM
(MAC `d0:cf:13:19:a3:70`), plain-text eFuse (未燒 SB/FE key).

驗證通過的路徑:

- **Boot**: ROM → bootloader → app，完整到 `main_task: Calling app_main()`
- **PSRAM**: 8 MB octal PSRAM @ 80 MHz init OK，heap allocator 正確接上
- **Wi-Fi STA**: 透過 BLE provisioning 註冊 SSID 成功，DHCP 拿到 IP
- **BLE (NimBLE)**: `wifi_prov_scheme_ble` advertising `Fan-TestKit`，PoP
  `abcd1234`，provisioning 完畢 `FREE_BTDM` 釋放 controller
- **HTTP + WebSocket**: `http://<ip>/` 吐出 dashboard，`/ws` 101 Switching
  Protocols，`set_pwm` / `set_rpm` JSON → `ctrl_cmd_queue` → `control_task`
  → sub-systems 全部驗證
- **PWM**: `mcpwm_new_timer` init @ 1 kHz 0% duty OK；dashboard Apply 真的
  改到 `control_task: pwm set: 1000 Hz, 50.00%`
- **RPM capture**: `mcpwm_new_cap_timer` init OK，GPIO6 timeout sentinel
  正常運作（無訊號 → 0 RPM）
- **TinyUSB composite**: `usb_comp: usb composite started (HID IF0 + CDC
  IF1/IF2)`，Windows Device Manager 看到 `USB Composite Device` →
  `HID-compliant vendor-defined device` + `USB 序列裝置 (COM8)`，
  VID/PID `0x303a:0x4005`

未驗證:

- ⬜ PWM GPIO4 實際波形（接 scope 量 1 kHz 50% square wave）
- ⬜ RPM capture 真的有資料進來（GPIO6 接訊號源）
- ⬜ Change-trigger pulse @ GPIO5
- ⬜ POST /ota（用 dashboard 上傳新 fw）
- ⬜ USB HID/CDC 實際流量（只確認 enumerate；沒跑 HID report 或 CDC
  SLIP OTA frame）
- ⬜ Secure Boot V2 / Flash Encryption（**目前關閉**，見 Bug 1）

## 本次 session 解掉的 bug（四個都已 fix + commit + push）

### Bug 1 — Secure Boot V2 + Flash Encryption 第一次 boot boot loop

**Symptom**: `rst:0x3 (RTC_SW_SYS_RST)` infinite loop，bootloader banner
都沒印出來就掛，`Saved PC:0x403cdb0a` = `process_segment` at
`esp_image_format.c:622`。

**Root cause**: 不確定是 SB 跟 FE 的 chicken-and-egg 互動、還是單一 feature
在全新 eFuse 上第一次 boot 就有問題。細節需要分開測試 (SB only / FE only)
來定位。

**Workaround**（Plan A）: `sdkconfig.defaults` 把
`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT` 跟 `CONFIG_SECURE_FLASH_ENC_ENABLED` 都設 `n`。
**現階段 eFuse 還沒燒（boot loop 發生在 digest burn 之前），所以 Plan A
是 safe 的；一旦 SB 或 FE 曾經成功 boot 過一次 eFuse 就不能回頭**，
`docs/release-hardening.md` 要搭配更新。

**下一步**: 先在 eFuse 純淨的板子上一次開一個 feature 測（先 SB only、
再 FE only、最後 combined），找到真正 root cause 再決定怎麼重啟 security。

### Bug 2 — `mcpwm_new_timer(82): invalid period ticks`

**Symptom**: app 過了 `pwm_gen_init()` 就 abort，`ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG`。

**Root cause**: MCPWM timer counter 是 16-bit
(`MCPWM_LL_MAX_COUNT_VALUE = 0x10000`)，但我們原本設
`resolution_hz = 160 MHz`，1 kHz 就算出 `period_ticks = 160000` 直接超界。

**Fix**: `components/pwm_gen/pwm_gen.c` 改成 `resolution_hz = 10 MHz`，
freq 支援範圍 153 Hz ~ 1 MHz（10 MHz / 65535 ≈ 153），duty resolution
從低頻 16 bits 到 1 MHz 3.3 bits 線性變化。`pwm_gen_duty_resolution_bits()`
目前回傳值跟實際情況對應得上。

### Bug 3 — Dashboard JS trailing NUL

**Symptom**: `app.js:60 Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token`
→ JS 不 load → WebSocket 不連 → Apply 按鈕沒反應、RPM 不 update。

**Root cause**: `EMBED_TXTFILES` 在 binary 尾端塞一個 `\0` 讓 C 能當
string 用，但 `_end` symbol 指在 NUL 之後。`serve_embedded` 送
`end - start` bytes 結果 browser 拿到 `app.js\0`，JS parser 炸掉。

**Fix**: `components/net_dashboard/net_dashboard.c` 的 `serve_embedded`
送 `end - start - 1`。HTML/CSS 同樣受益，只是 browser 對 CSS/HTML 的
trailing NUL 比較寬容沒炸。

上述三個 fix 在 commit `e905b56` (`fix: 打通 hardware bring-up 三個
boot/runtime bug`)。

### Bug 4 — TinyUSB composite descriptor 不枚舉

**Symptom**:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD004 MD032 -->
```text
E (981) tusb_desc: tinyusb_set_descriptors(183): Configuration descriptor must be provided for this device
E (990) TinyUSB: tinyusb_driver_install(90): Descriptors config failed
W (1002) app: USB composite init failed: ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD004 MD032 -->

**Root cause**: `esp_tinyusb 1.7.x` 的 default config descriptor 只 cover
CDC/MSC/NCM/VENDOR，**不處理 HID**。只要 `CFG_TUD_HID > 0`，
`tinyusb_set_descriptors` 就會強制要求 user 提供
`configuration_descriptor`，否則 install 整個被 reject。CLAUDE.md 原本
寫的「1.x auto-generates HID+CDC composite descriptors from Kconfig」
是**錯的**，已更正。

**Fix**: `components/usb_composite/usb_composite.c` 手寫 composite config
descriptor，layout:

```text
IF0          HID (1 IN EP @ 0x81, 16-byte packet, 10 ms polling)
IF1 + IF2    CDC (notif IN @ 0x82, bulk OUT @ 0x03, bulk IN @ 0x83)
```

`TUD_HID_DESCRIPTOR()` 要 compile-time report desc length，寫死
`HID_REPORT_DESC_SIZE = 53` 並在 `usb_descriptors.c` 加
`_Static_assert(sizeof(usb_hid_report_descriptor) == 53)` 綁住。

這個 fix 在 commit `be4a9ad` (`fix(usb): 提供 composite config descriptor
讓 HID+CDC 枚舉`)。

App 本身被設計成 USB init 失敗 graceful degradation — 即使 Bug 4 沒
解，其他 subsystem 照跑。這個 graceful pattern 保留著，有新 USB 問題
時不會把整個 app 拖下來。

## Environment housekeeping 本次 session 變更

- `credential.helper` (global): `wincred` → `manager`
  （要改回：`git config --global credential.helper wincred`）
- `gh` CLI active account: `billwang-gmt-project` → `billwanggithub`
  （要切回：`gh auth switch --user billwang-gmt-project`）
- Remote `origin` 指向 `git@github.com:billwanggithub/Fan-TestKit-ESP32.git` (原 `ESP32_PWM` repo 在 github.com rename 過來，history 一樣)
  （不變，只是第一次 push force-push 過，原本 remote 的孤立
  `Initial commit` 被蓋掉）

## 下一步

全部「必做」都已完成並 push 上 main。以下是後續 polish/驗證項目，
沒有嚴格順序。

1. 硬體量測 PWM / RPM 實際波形（scope 接 GPIO4 看 1 kHz 50% square wave；
   GPIO5 看 change trigger pulse；GPIO6 餵訊號源看 RPM capture 真的有
   讀到）。
2. USB HID / CDC 實際流量測試：Windows 端用 `hidapi` 或 `HidHide` 送
   `set_pwm` report 給 `0x303a:0x4005`；COM8 打開看 CDC log mirror；
   寫最小 Python SLIP client 送 OTA frame。
3. POST /ota 驗證：dashboard 上傳新 firmware 看 `ota_writer_task` 接收 +
   重啟。
4. 分開啟用 Secure Boot V2 / Flash Encryption 做 bisect，找到 Bug 1 的
   真正 root cause。步驟已記在 `docs/release-hardening.md` 的新 Stage
   0.5。
5. WS2812 @ GPIO48 加上 `led_strip` 做 status LED（idle / provisioning /
   wifi-connected / ota-in-progress 各一個顏色）。

## Board-specific reminders

- USB2 的 0 Ω jumper 必須在 **USB-OTG**（TinyUSB 才能接手 D-/D+；
  `USB-JTAG` 位置下 D-/D+ 被 USB-JTAG peripheral 搶走，TinyUSB 會
  install OK 但 host 看不到枚舉）。UART console 一直在 USB1 不受
  jumper 影響。
- GPIO 19/20 保留給 USB，絕對不要分給 PWM 或 capture。
- GPIO 0/3/45/46 是 strapping pin，避免當成 drive high/low output。

## Language preference

本次 session 已經改回 晶晶體 (中英混搭)。Commit title 保持 English-first
（git log 可讀性），body 走晶晶體。參考
`C:\Users\billw\.claude\memory\feedback_language.md`。
